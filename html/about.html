        <h2>Baldur's Gate story</h2>
        <p>
            Baldur’s Gate, known as the “Gateway to the Realms,” was founded in the year of 1356 DR (Dale Reckoning) by the powerful Bhaalspawn Bhaal, the Lord of Murder. It was built at the mouth of the Chionthar River, on the western coast of the Sword Coast, in what is now known as the Western Heartlands.In its early years, Baldur’s Gate was a small fishing village, but as more settlers arrived, it quickly grew into a thriving trading port. The city’s founders saw its potential as a major hub for trade and commerce, and as a result, they began to expand the city’s walls and fortifications. This attracted even more settlers and traders, and the city soon became one of the largest and most prosperous cities in the Sword Coast.
